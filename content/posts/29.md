For sometime now, I was searching for an alternative for [Go][go]. While the language itself is nice and I am productive with it, there are reasons to look elsewhere. 

> Now stared with [Zig][zig].

While working with [Go][go], I thought there could not be simpler thing than this. Installation is smooth, works on every platform and fast. Infact this blog runs on [Hugo][hugo], which runs on [Go][go]. But lately there are data mining and other corporate politics is happening in that space. After all Google! 

I was hearing about [Zig][zig], but never really looked into it. This weekend finally I got into making something with it. It is not much but a commandline program to get some values and display some values. Took me just few minutes to be productive. Same feeling as in [Go][go] but then found the alternative.

Installation is just unzipping a folder and adding that to the system's path. And we are ready to [Zig][zig]. It has C and C++ compiler built in, it can compile for another OS from another OS!

Let's [Zig][zig] now.
