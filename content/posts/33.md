I never thought, the day will come! The story of [VIM][vim] addiction and [NeoVIM][nvim] [adoption](#neovim-and-ubuntu).

In search of a code editor which is available everywhere, from Desktop to servers, I accidentally got used to `vi` some years back. I had to edit some files on the server or they call it `Cloud`, the only editor available there was `vi`. I just used it and forgot it as it was not even close to anything that modern code editors offer.

The thing came back to me, when I switch to `Ubuntu` as my daily work machine. Well still I do a lot with [`Sublime Text`][sublime] but this [vi][vim] is just there. Before I knew, I started using it now and then.

I did not need a lot of plug-ins, just the text editor is enough for me for occasional editing. Slowly as I started using it more frequently, the only plugin I needed was a file tree. So the `NERDTree` is perfect for me till date. 

Now there is [NeoVIM][nvim], which is just [VIM][vim] on the frontend. Which means for a [VIM][vim] user there is no difference but the underlying development is changed completely. I resisted for 2 years but once I configured and used it, it seems just natural to be with it.

### NeoVIM and Ubuntu


Like other things in Ubuntu, just download the binary bundle, extract into a folder, set the path in `~/.bashrc` and ready to go with [`NeoVIM`][nvim]. Instead of `vi` one has to use `nvim` on commandline.


 - Can be configured through `init.vim` or `init.lua` file. Not both at the same time.
 - Location of these files are in `$HOME/.config/nvim/`
 - This `nvim` folder have to be created manually
 - Plug-ins are just github repositories. Just download and place it in `pack` folder inside `$HOME/.config/nvim/` folder. Then add a `require` satement on the `config` file.

```
 require('lualine').setup()
```

 - There are plugin managers and there are choices there also. However, for me this github repo download works fine.
