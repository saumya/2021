      Namaskaram.
It happened last week, Inner Engineering Completion in person program, near me. Personally, it was a long wait to be a part of this event in person. Never thought, it would be such a surprise to me! Overall it was as usual, pleasant and smooth with high energy flowing all-around. I bow down to all the volunteers, who brought it here.
Being a Volunteer in the event has a different meaning altogether.

        Product or Technology

    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      This is always the case. It is always OR never AND.
There are talks about how technology is the key to a successful product. May be it is true in the beginning, till one has to maintain it. Almost all successful products in the market are not of the latest technolgy. There are some parts of it is new technology, but majority is old, very old. The technology they use are once new, but now it is old and that is ok.

        Working with YARN
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Working in Yarn was a little involved. That is Yarn version 1. One has to play around with Node and NPM to make things setup. With Yarn version 2 and above, this is mostly done by Node and a new utility called corepack.
Now, Yarn does not need to be installed as a global package. Yarn can be enabled for individual projects (individual folders).
The corepack enable is all there is to it.

        React State update
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Updating a state in React looks something like below.
const [count, setCount] = useState(0) setCount(5) Here the new value of the count is provided to setCount. That updates the state of count to its new value.
This is the most used form of the state update.
However, there is another form of this functionality. This looks like below.
setState( previousState=&gt;{ // Do Something with Previous Data // And return the newly created Data return( newState ) } ) So the code setCount(5) will become like below.

        React Component and props.children
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      The game of React is in its components. Almost everything here is a component. Sooner or later the need to pass properties to components will arise. This is straight forward as we know like this.
&lt;MyComp myTitle=&#39;Nice Component&#39; /&gt; Inside component we can access this with props.myTitle.
const MyComp = (props)=&gt;{	return( &lt;div&gt; { props.myTitle } &lt;/div&gt; ) } This can also be written as below.
const MyComp = ( {myTitle} )=&gt;{	return( &lt;div&gt; { myTitle } &lt;/div&gt; ) } There is a nice magic props that React has, on all the components.
