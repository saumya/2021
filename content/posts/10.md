[Powerline][1] is a wonderful utility apart from visually pleasing shell prompts.

In the early days it was a whole lot of effort to install and apply it to Linux / Ubuntu. However the situations have changed. Now it is  

```
sudo apt install powerline
```
and there you have it.

Now to add this to [Fish][2], the best way is to use [Oh My Fish][3]. Once [Oh My Fish][3] is installed, enable `bobthefish` theme. This can be done by using the command below.

```
omf theme bobthefish
```

This makes [Fish][2] with a beautiful [Powerline][1]

The beauty of this is once the [Powerline][1] is installed, it installs everything with it, the fonts, the dependency for Python scripts and all those. Previously it was a mannual job to configure everything by hand. 

Since [Powerline][1] is written in Python, sometimes this simple installation process might not show the desired effect! In that case the solution that worked for me is 

 1. Uninstall Powerline
 2. Install Python3
 3. Install [Pip3][4]
 4. Install Powerline
 5. Enable the theme in [Oh My Fish][3]

Happy Fishing
