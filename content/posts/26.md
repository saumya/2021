In my last post I talked about the problem with Ubuntu 23.04.

While my laptop was workable but not optimal. I could not controll the brightness of the screen. I was hoping Ubuntu will fix this with an update. And that is what has happened.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Those two are not new to any Ubuntu user. But with these two, Ubuntu got the fix for the brightness control problem. There might be other fixes too. For me, I got the things I was waiting for.

Back to work :)
