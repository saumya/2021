        React Component and props.children
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      The game of React is in its components. Almost everything here is a component. Sooner or later the need to pass properties to components will arise. This is straight forward as we know like this.
&lt;MyComp myTitle='Nice Component' /&gt; Inside component we can access this with props.myTitle.
const MyComp = (props)=&gt;{	return( &lt;div&gt; { props.myTitle } &lt;/div&gt; ) } This can also be written as below.
const MyComp = ( {myTitle} )=&gt;{	return( &lt;div&gt; { myTitle } &lt;/div&gt; ) }  There is a nice magic props that React has, on all the components.

        Managing Component Code in ReactJS
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      React defines and speculates about how to manage code files for components. There are so many documentation and tools available as per the best practices and perfect scenaios. However as per my experience no perfect scenario ever worked for any individual or company.
 There is difference between perfect scenario and working scenario.
 While everyone should try to stick to the best practices and perfect scenarios, it is a perpetual job.

      My working machine is a Linux machine for some years now.
I never felt this kind of freedom and productive before. Now I can say it is even better than MacOS in terms of developer freedom and easiness. It is better than Windows in terms of GUI applications. The time has gone when Linux used to be command only. Today the GUI applications are much better in Linux than Windows.

        SVG on Web
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      SVG is fine jsut to know it as an image format.
However, to deal with SVG on a web application as a developer is a different thing. SVG is too generic for better or worse as Javascript. Unless you know your way through it, it might seem confusing or easy.
First is there are many ways to include SVG in web.
The basic is just the tag itself. It is a valid HTML tag.

        VIM Plugin NERDTree
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Installing a VIM plugin in Ubuntu is not that complicated as it used to be. All one has to do is put the plugin in a proper folder. However, do not confuse yourself VIM with VI. By default Ubuntu comes installed with VI and not VIM. Even if you put the VIM plugin in the proper place, it will not reflect in this editor.
 First install VIM.
 For Ubuntu it is just sudo apt install vim.
