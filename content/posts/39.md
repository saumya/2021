Seems like a known bug.
 > Upgrade from 22.04 LTS to 24.04 LTS and the connection to internet is broken

In my case, I upgraded to 24.04.1. The bug still is there. The fix I do is from [this place][2]. I have to do it almost every time I open the OS.

```
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo dhcpcd
```
Now as [mentioned in the post][2] internet is back but the icon on the taskbar is still broken. To fix this UI, this is the command.

```
sudo apt install systemd-resolved
```

However, this last command is not always needed. The two commands does the job.
