    <h1>Reviving my MacBookPro</h1>

      <p>The thing is, Apple does not care about anything else but money.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple products are good.</li>
<li>They work as Apple expects them to work.</li>
<li>People just follow along and pride themselves for having an Apple device.</li>
<li>The products die when Apple wants them to die.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now my device, MacBookPro which is still good in terms of Hardware, Apple software does not get updated in this. As per Apple the device needs an upgrade. Well that is when I thought of other options. I am definitely not going to get another Apple developer machine. I brought this one to learn <code>ObjectiveC</code> and later it helped me learn <code>Swift</code>. That is all and that is done.</p>
<p>For a long time I could not thought of doing anything with this device. One fine day I tried to install Ubuntu latest in this one. And behold the new machine! I could not believe myself and the machine either!</p>
<p>I have a running development machine again. It is fast and beautiful. Though it could not run the heavier softwares like video editing and 3D modelling that smooth, it definitely is not going to die now. I must say Linux does not get that much of credit as it should.</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>
