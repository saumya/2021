[SVG][1] is fine jsut to know it as an image format.

However, to deal with SVG on a web application as a developer is a different thing. [SVG][1] is too generic for better or worse as Javascript. Unless you know your way through it, it might seem confusing or easy.

First is there are many ways to include [SVG][1] in web.

The basic is just the tag itself. It is a valid HTML tag. So basically the SVG thing can be added inside an HTML page as tags like `div` and `span`.

```

<body>
 <svg> The SVG tags go here </svg>
</body>

```

Next is `img` tag. We can do that too. Put an svg in an Image tag.

```
<img src='the_svg_file.svg'></img>
```

And then there is `Embed` tag.

```
<embed type="image/svg+xml" src="image.svg" />
```

Looking at all this, seems fine that we just have choices to add SVG into HTML page. This is true. Just remember that SVg can also be scriptable! That is a whole new game. It is like old days of Flash. We can just add `Javascript` inside SVG and control it. For this to happen the requirement is we have to add it in the page using `Embed` tag.
