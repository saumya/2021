      <p>A long wait is finally over.</p>
<p>For a long long time I was lazy and was avoiding the work. But here it is.</p>
<p>Moved to the <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo Engine</a> from <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">Wintersmith Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Never thought I will continue this way. But this is good to start over and over again. This is life if one wants to live. Re-start, Re-build, Re-structure and keep living.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/">last blog is here</a> for the new visitors here.</p>
<p>For last some years my frequency of blogging was slower than usual. That was another reason, why I was not putting effort on upgrading to new engine. Somehow things are moving in a different direction. That made me think, if I am going to do it anyway, why not now. So the upgrade. And with this, I have released the <a href="https://github.com/saumya/saumya_go_walk">theme(GoWalk) of this site as opensource</a>. It is simple and open, customise it and use it, if you want.</p>
<p>Have a happy life.</p>
