        React Native, 2025.
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      React Native still is and better than ever the toolchain for crossplatform application development. As usual the new version React Native toolchain keeps on changing. The documentation of the toolchain also keeps on changing(they call it evolving, not me).
Starting a new project is now done as this
npx @react-native-community/cli init MyNewReactNativeApp For a particular version of React Native, the command is like this.
npx @react-native-community/cli init MyApp --version &#34;0.75&#34; This is basically using the community cli

        NPM script basics
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      In package.json there is a script section. From here one can run NPM Scripts.
&#34;scripts&#34;: {&#34;one&#34;: &#34;scriptOne.js&#34;,&#34;two&#34;: &#34;scriptTwo.js&#34;} These can be run like this.
npm run one This particular line will run scriptOne.js. This is powerful as we could take Node&rsquo;s power and run any automated task for ourselves.
At first this seemed simple to me. Soon I came across cross-platform bugs. Since we are writing this in JS, it could be run anywhere Node is available.

        NeoVIM on Windows
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      We will be talking about Windows 11 and NeoVIM. It can be seen as general Windows not specific to Windows 11, since I have done it in Windows 11, thought would mention it here in order to avoid the confusion.
On Windows machines I avoided configuring or even using NeoVIM. Thought it would be much more painful here as compared to Linux. So started using NeoVIM on WSL. Configured and ready within a couple of minutes as that is basically all Linux.

        NeoVIM Configuration basics
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Configuring NeoVIM is straight forward. All one need to know is, where to put what.
Here is a list of references to get started with it.
For me, it was not difficult as I just needed a decent text editor with a file tree. All I did is pull the respective github repos into the folder and call them from init,lua. This is nice and fine but since the configuration is too easy and Lua just feels good to play with, thinking of confuguring it further and play with plugin managers.

      I never thought, the day will come! The story of VIM addiction and NeoVIM adoption.
In search of a code editor which is available everywhere, from Desktop to servers, I accidentally got used to vi some years back. I had to edit some files on the server or they call it Cloud, the only editor available there was vi. I just used it and forgot it as it was not even close to anything that modern code editors offer.

Hype Driven Development.
It should be a known story for experienced developers. For new developers it is alright to start here.
The problem is never the tool itself. How it is been used, the implementation details. That is the place, where it matters.
During the last days of FlashPlayer, the company and the community both jumped into Flex, the framework and the tool-chain to say, everything can be fixed with it!

    <div class="summary-description">
      Installing Linux side by side on a Windows machine, was and still is simple.
However, now a days there is one more / extra step before installing Linux(specifically Ubuntu) on a Windows machine. Now a days the hardware and the boot option comes with a setting called Secure Boot. This option is by default it is enabled for a new laptop running on Windows 11. This is to make the system secure at boot level and Windows 11 requires this option to be available in order to be installed on the system.

      I always knew this from my experience that, Windows, the OS is broken in a lot of ways for development. However, once I shifted out of it never thought about it. In a recent turn of events, I am back in a Windows Machine for ReactNative development. And the old ghosts are back alive! Tried a lot of things, but the old trick did the job for me.

Now stared with Zig.
While working with Go, I thought there could not be simpler thing than this. Installation is smooth, works on every platform and fast. Infact this blog runs on Hugo, which runs on Go. But lately there are data mining and other corporate politics is happening in that space.

While my laptop was workable but not optimal. I could not controll the brightness of the screen. I was hoping Ubuntu will fix this with an update. And that is what has happened.
sudo apt updatesudo apt upgrade Those two are not new to any Ubuntu user. But with these two, Ubuntu got the fix for the brightness control problem.

Yep, it is true.
The deal is, who takes the instructions seriously.
I am talking in general here. Once you accept something as valuable, a book or a guide, then taking it as instructed makes a whole difference. Problem arises when one becomes a little casual about the instructions of value. Then it does not matter, what are you doing, there will not be desired result.

      Updating a state in React looks something like below.
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)setCount(5) Here the new value of the count is provided to setCount. That updates the state of count to its new value.
This is the most used form of the state update.
However, there is another form of this functionality. This looks like below.
setState( previousState=&gt;{// Do Something with Previous Data// And return the newly created Datareturn( newState )} ) So the code setCount(5) will become like below.

const MyComp = (props)=&gt;{	return(&lt;div&gt;{ props.myTitle }&lt;/div&gt;)} This can also be written as below.
const MyComp = ( {myTitle} )=&gt;{	return(&lt;div&gt;{ myTitle }&lt;/div&gt;)} There is a nice magic props that React has, on all the components.

First is there are many ways to include SVG in web.
The basic is just the tag itself. It is a valid HTML tag.

      Installing a VIM plugin in Ubuntu is not that complicated as it used to be. All one has to do is put the plugin in a proper folder. However, do not confuse yourself VIM with VI. By default Ubuntu comes installed with VI and not VIM. Even if you put the VIM plugin in the proper place, it will not reflect in this editor.
First install VIM.
For Ubuntu it is just sudo apt install vim.

    <div class="summary-description">
      In the noisy space of Javascript and Javascript Frameworks, this one is nice and quiet. The simplicity of this framework dragged me into it. This happens to me for a new framework which does the thing and keeps it simple. Same thing happened to me when React came in. Appart from its corporate backing, it did work for a couple of years. As usual slowly complexity built arround it. I am afraid Alpine might go that route.

      Python is powerful like anyother programming language. However the simplicity of it makes it more beautiful.
I was trying to automate some of my tasks and this needed copying of a folder with all its files and folders and files inside those folders to a new location. With Python it just took some lines and the task is done!
import shutil
shutil.copytree(source_folder, destination_folder, dirs_exist_ok = True)
The shutil is a utility to deal with file operations.

        Setting different Yarn versions in Ubuntu / Linux
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      This should be a one liner as per the Yarn Docs.
It doesnot work always like that.
The problem This happens if you have installed the latest version of Yarn. Then and only then one can change Yarn versions. After installing the latest version of Yarn, we can use the old version by setting Yarn to older version.
yarn set version classic
The classic version is 1.x version.
At this point we are good for our projects which use Yarn version 1.

In the early days it was a whole lot of effort to install and apply it to Linux / Ubuntu. However the situations have changed. Now it is
sudo apt install powerline and there you have it.
Now to add this to Fish, the best way is to use Oh My Fish. Once Oh My Fish is installed, enable bobthefish theme.

      The natural progress of the frontend tooling. Whether you like it or not, change is here to stay. At the moment the frontend frameworks have reached a point, where we need something else to have a better Developer Experience.
Applications were always like this and will remain like this.
What could change is how we write these applications. Divisions have been made to separate the concerns. However in frontend, we had put very little effort in terms of development for a long long time.

The reality of the life of the code is very different from the literature around it.
All the reusabilty and other thoughts look good in books. In reality I have hardly seen any code is re-used. This is not to diminish the reusabilty of the code.

I was working on a project which is old. Not so old but kind of not recent also. And we just pushed our production application to live environment.
At that point I have some time to update the project. So I did. The first upgrade I thought should be the React library itself.

In terms of frontend technology it is React through and through. It was a re-write of the old project. The project has a global reach and directly affects people. Whatever we are doing has a direct effect on the general people.

        Hugo &amp; Paths
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Hugo is fast and just works. However there are certain things you must take into consideration while hosting it.
Till now one thing I came across is the path for css files. Hugo provides template short codes to deal with them.
The templating system cares for empty spaces in the template.
You should be extra careful not to put them. For example href=&quot;{{ .Site.BaseURL }}css/2021.css&quot; and href=&quot;{{ .Site.BaseURL }} css/2021.css&quot; are different.

For a long long time I was lazy and was avoiding the work. But here it is.
Moved to the Hugo Engine from Wintersmith Engine.
Never thought I will continue this way. But this is good to start over and over again. This is life if one wants to live. Re-start, Re-build, Re-structure and keep living.
