Configuring NeoVIM is straight forward. All one need to know is, where to put what.

Here is a [list of references](#reference-readings) to get started with it.

For me, it was not difficult as I just needed a decent text editor with a file tree. All I did is pull the respective github repos into the folder and call them from `init,lua`. This is nice and fine but since the configuration is too easy and `Lua` just feels good to play with, thinking of confuguring it further and play with plugin managers.

```
nvim
├── init.lua
└── lua
    ├── colorscheme.lua
    ├── config
    │   └── nvim-cmp.lua
    ├── keymaps.lua
    ├── lsp.lua
    ├── options.lua
    └── plugins.lua
```

The above is the basic structure of the configuration.

Below is the total structure of the configuration that I have.

```
    nvim
    ├── init.lua
    ├── pack
    │    └── my-plugins
    │        ├── start
    │        │    ├── plugin-a
    │        │    └── plugin-b
    │        └── opt
    │            ├── plugin-one
    │            └── plugin-two   
    │
    └── lua
        ├── colorscheme.lua
        ├── config
        │   └── nvim-cmp.lua
        ├── keymaps.lua
        ├── lsp.lua
        ├── options.lua
        └── plugins.lua
```


I think my transition from Vim to NeoVim is complete.
