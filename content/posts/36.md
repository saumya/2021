In `package.json` there is a `script` section. From here one can run NPM Scripts.

```
"scripts": {
	"one": "scriptOne.js",
	"two": "scriptTwo.js"
}
```
These can be run like this.

```
npm run one
```

This particular line will run `scriptOne.js`. This is powerful as we could take Node's power and run any automated task for ourselves.

At first this seemed simple to me. Soon I came across cross-platform bugs. Since we are writing this in `JS`, it could be run anywhere `Node` is available. Now that could be a tricky thing. Some environments deal with certain things in a certain way. This is not a big thing if the script is written to handle those situations. Another thing is `Node` versions. If the script is written using certain API of a particular `Node` version, it is better to keep an eye on new releases of Node and update the script if there are breaking changes.

Note for a better script writing and running:

 - The script should work in crossplatform environments
 - Keep an eye on Node version while running the script ( It may be possible, the script is written using newer version of Node than you are currently running it on. )
