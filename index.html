        Ubuntu 24.04 and internet access

    <div class="summary-description">
      <p>Seems like a known bug.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upgrade from 22.04 LTS to 24.04 LTS and the connection to internet is broken</p></blockquote>
<p>In my case, I upgraded to 24.04.1. The bug still is there. The fix I do is from <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1530964">this place</a>. I have to do it almost every time I open the OS.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo dhcpcd
</code></pre><p>Now as <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1530964">mentioned in the post</a> internet is back but the icon on the taskbar is still broken. To fix this UI, this is the command.</p>

        Ubuntu 24.04 is with an unstable installer
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      <p>The latest LTS release of Ubuntu, 24.04 is having a very unstable installer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could install it from the installer in some machines without any problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the installer simply is a UI only update. On the UX side it fails completely. Seems there is no error handling done. On simplest of things, the installer just shuts down.</p>
<p>On one of my laptops, I find it is very difficult to go forword with installation. Made an attempt to install the previous version of Ubuntu, which is 22.04 and it went smooth.</p>

      <p><a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a> still is and better than ever the toolchain for crossplatform application development. As usual the new version React Native toolchain keeps on changing. The documentation of the toolchain also keeps on changing(<del>they call it evolving</del>, not me).</p>
<p>Starting a new project is now done as this</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>npx @react-native-community/cli init MyNewReactNativeApp

        NPM script basics
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      <p>In <code>package.json</code> there is a <code>script</code> section. From here one can run NPM Scripts.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;scripts&#34;: {
	&#34;one&#34;: &#34;scriptOne.js&#34;,
	&#34;two&#34;: &#34;scriptTwo.js&#34;
}
</code></pre><p>These can be run like this.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>npm run one
</code></pre><p>This particular line will run <code>scriptOne.js</code>. This is powerful as we could take Node&rsquo;s power and run any automated task for ourselves.</p>
<p>At first this seemed simple to me. Soon I came across cross-platform bugs. Since we are writing this in <code>JS</code>, it could be run anywhere <code>Node</code> is available. Now that could be a tricky thing. Some environments deal with certain things in a certain way. This is not a big thing if the script is written to handle those situations. Another thing is <code>Node</code> versions. If the script is written using certain API of a particular <code>Node</code> version, it is better to keep an eye on new releases of Node and update the script if there are breaking changes.</p>

        NeoVIM on Windows
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      <p>We will be talking about Windows 11 and NeoVIM. It can be seen as general Windows not specific to Windows 11, since I have done it in Windows 11, thought would mention it here in order to avoid the confusion.</p>
<p>On Windows machines I avoided configuring or even using NeoVIM. Thought it would be much more painful here as compared to Linux. So started using NeoVIM on WSL. Configured and ready within a couple of minutes as that is basically all Linux. Then I thought, let me try on Windows once and that would be final. If it runs fine if not better. It seemed the people at NeoVIM has made it clear that this thing is for everyone, including Windows people.</p>
