      <p>I never thought, the day will come! The story of <a href="https://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> addiction and <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVIM</a> <a href="#neovim-and-ubuntu">adoption</a>.</p>
<p>In search of a code editor which is available everywhere, from Desktop to servers, I accidentally got used to <code>vi</code> some years back. I had to edit some files on the server or they call it <code>Cloud</code>, the only editor available there was <code>vi</code>. I just used it and forgot it as it was not even close to anything that modern code editors offer.</p>
<p>The thing came back to me, when I switch to <code>Ubuntu</code> as my daily work machine. Well still I do a lot with <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"><code>Sublime Text</code></a> but this <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vi</a> is just there. Before I knew, I started using it now and then.</p>
<p>I did not need a lot of plug-ins, just the text editor is enough for me for occasional editing. Slowly as I started using it more frequently, the only plugin I needed was a file tree. So the <code>NERDTree</code> is perfect for me till date.</p>
<p>Now there is <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVIM</a>, which is just <a href="https://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> on the frontend. Which means for a <a href="https://www.vim.org/">VIM</a> user there is no difference but the underlying development is changed completely. I resisted for 2 years but once I configured and used it, it seems just natural to be with it.</p>
<h3 id="neovim-and-ubuntu">NeoVIM and Ubuntu</h3>
<p>Like other things in Ubuntu, just download the binary bundle, extract into a folder, set the path in <code>~/.bashrc</code> and ready to go with <a href="https://neovim.io/"><code>NeoVIM</code></a>. Instead of <code>vi</code> one has to use <code>nvim</code> on commandline.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be configured through <code>init.vim</code> or <code>init.lua</code> file. Not both at the same time.</li>
<li>Location of these files are in <code>$HOME/.config/nvim/</code></li>
<li>This <code>nvim</code> folder have to be created manually</li>
<li>Plug-ins are just github repositories. Just download and place it in <code>pack</code> folder inside <code>$HOME/.config/nvim/</code> folder. Then add a <code>require</code> satement on the <code>config</code> file.</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code> require(&#39;lualine&#39;).setup()
</code></pre><ul>
<li>There are plugin managers and there are choices there also. However, for me this github repo download works fine.</li>
<li>Here is a video explaining <a href="%5Bhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8C0Cq9Uv9o%5D">NeoVIM configuration</a></li>
