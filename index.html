        SVG on Web
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      SVG is fine jsut to know it as an image format.
However, to deal with SVG on a web application as a developer is a different thing. SVG is too generic for better or worse as Javascript. Unless you know your way through it, it might seem confusing or easy.
First is there are many ways to include SVG in web.
The basic is just the tag itself. It is a valid HTML tag.

        VIM Plugin NERDTree
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Installing a VIM plugin in Ubuntu is not that complicated as it used to be. All one has to do is put the plugin in a proper folder. However, do not confuse yourself VIM with VI. By default Ubuntu comes installed with VI and not VIM. Even if you put the VIM plugin in the proper place, it will not reflect in this editor.
 First install VIM.
 For Ubuntu it is just sudo apt install vim.

        Alpine JS
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      In the noisy space of Javascript and Javascript Frameworks, this one is nice and quiet. The simplicity of this framework dragged me into it. This happens to me for a new framework which does the thing and keeps it simple. Same thing happened to me when React came in. Appart from its corporate backing, it did work for a couple of years. As usual slowly complexity built arround it. I am afraid Alpine might go that route.

        Copying folder with Python
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Python is powerful like anyother programming language. However the simplicity of it makes it more beautiful.
I was trying to automate some of my tasks and this needed copying of a folder with all its files and folders and files inside those folders to a new location. With Python it just took some lines and the task is done!
 import shutil
shutil.copytree(source_folder, destination_folder, dirs_exist_ok = True)
 The shutil is a utility to deal with file operations.

        Setting different Yarn versions in Ubuntu / Linux
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      This should be a one liner as per the Yarn Docs.
It doesnot work always like that.
The problem This happens if you have installed the latest version of Yarn. Then and only then one can change Yarn versions. After installing the latest version of Yarn, we can use the old version by setting Yarn to older version.
 yarn set version classic
 The classic version is 1.x version.
