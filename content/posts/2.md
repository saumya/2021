[Hugo][1] is fast and just works.
However there are certain things you must take into consideration while hosting it.

Till now one thing I came across is the `path` for `css` files. [Hugo][1] provides template short codes to deal with them.

> The templating system cares for empty spaces in the template.

You should be extra careful not to put them.
For example ` href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}css/2021.css" ` and ` href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }} css/2021.css" ` are different. Can you see there is a space between `}}` and `css/2021.css` in the second example. These kind of things will break the site or theme or both.

However it is a pleasant experience working with this new setup.

Happy Coding.
