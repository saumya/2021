title: "ReactNative. Developing on Windows"

I always knew this from my experience that, `Windows, the OS is broken` in a lot of ways for development. However, once I shifted out of it never thought about it. In a recent turn of events, I am back in a `Windows Machine` for ReactNative development. And the old ghosts are back alive! Tried a lot of things, but the old trick did the job for me.

In my project, I was constantly getting this error while building for Android. 

> ninja: error: manifest 'build.ninja' still dirty after 100 tries

After a week of trying by myself and troubling the team, i found this to be a known problem having multiple solutions, like [this(1)][1] and [this(2)][2] ! For me the solution was given by someone in the [option 2][2]!

> Just a weird problem with Windows. I made it work just by moving the project folder to a shorter path.


This I knew since `Windows 98` days! And this is still true in 2023! The underlaying OS is somewhere broken for development.

No matter how much sugar coated the system is, it is not for a serious develpment experience except `Windows only` development things.
