Configuring NeoVIM is straight forward. All one need to know where to put what.

This is a [nice read][1] to get started with it.

For me, it was not difficult as I just needed a decent text editor with a file tree. All I did is pull the respective github repos into the folder and call them from `init,lua`. This is nice and fine but since the configuration is too easy and `Lua` just feels good to play with, thinking of confuguring it further and play with plugin managers.

```
nvim
├── init.lua
└── lua
    ├── colorscheme.lua
    ├── config
    │   └── nvim-cmp.lua
    ├── keymaps.lua
    ├── lsp.lua
    ├── options.lua
    └── plugins.lua
```

This is the basic structure of the configuration.


I think my transition from Vim to NeoVim is over and I am here to stay for some time.
