        Powerline Fish
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Powerline is a wonderful utility apart from visually pleasing shell prompts.
In the early days it was a whole lot of effort to install and apply it to Linux / Ubuntu. However the situations have changed. Now it is
sudo apt install powerline and there you have it.
Now to add this to Fish, the best way is to use Oh My Fish. Once Oh My Fish is installed, enable bobthefish theme.

      Setting up any UNIX like system comes down to a single startup file. There could be many, if one wants to, the freedom is always there. But generally it starts at a single point.
OSX / MacOS In this land the file is .bash_profile. Almost all the things can be configured here.
UBUNTU / Linux Here the file is .bashrc. All the PATH and systemwide settings reside here.
 Both of these files stay in the root of the user home folder in both MacOS and UBUNTU.

        2021 Retrospect.

    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      The year started slow but kept up the steadiness. There were a lot of endings and new beginnings. As always if it flows, it is life.
Tech and work  A new project started.
 For a long long time I was in a stealth mode. Bootstrapping and failing, then start over again and fail. The cycle finally ended. There are huge experience gain in terms of building a product and selling it.

      The natural progress of the frontend tooling. Whether you like it or not, change is here to stay. At the moment the frontend frameworks have reached a point, where we need something else to have a better Developer Experience.
 Applications were always like this and will remain like this.
 What could change is how we write these applications. Divisions have been made to separate the concerns. However in frontend, we had put very little effort in terms of development for a long long time.

    <div class="summary-description">
      The thing that is fixed in code is the change. While lot of books and philosophy is done towards how to reuse the code, very little is focused towards the change!
 The reality of the life of the code is very different from the literature around it.
 All the reusabilty and other thoughts look good in books. In reality I have hardly seen any code is re-used. This is not to diminish the reusabilty of the code.

        Single knowledge base
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      The age old problem which repeats itself is, how to make a single code base for a project which is delivered to multiple platforms?!
 Many tachnologies has come and promised the same thing. The end result is to enter the corporate space. Why!? Money.
 This is the true story of all the technology stacks which promise to have a single codebase. Some really nice technologies has come and stayed for good, some vanished without leaving a trace.

        React 17. FastRefresh, not HotReload.
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      A must upgrade version of React is React 17. I was surprised by the things it brings to the equation.
 I was working on a project which is old. Not so old but kind of not recent also. And we just pushed our production application to live environment.
 At that point I have some time to update the project. So I did. The first upgrade I thought should be the React library itself.

        Project went live.

    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      For last 5 months, I was working on a new project. Finally it went live last week.
 It is such an experience to be involved in this kind of projects.
 In terms of frontend technology it is React through and through. It was a re-write of the old project. The project has a global reach and directly affects people. Whatever we are doing has a direct effect on the general people.

        Hugo &amp; Paths
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Hugo is fast and just works. However there are certain things you must take into consideration while hosting it.
Till now one thing I came across is the path for css files. Hugo provides template short codes to deal with them.
 The templating system cares for empty spaces in the template.
 You should be extra careful not to put them. For example href=&quot;{{ .Site.BaseURL }}css/2021.css&quot; and href=&quot;{{ .Site.BaseURL }} css/2021.

        New Again.
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      A long wait is finally over.
For a long long time I was lazy and was avoiding the work. But here it is.
Moved to the Hugo Engine from Wintersmith Engine.
Never thought I will continue this way. But this is good to start over and over again. This is life if one wants to live. Re-start, Re-build, Re-structure and keep living.
The last blog is here for the new visitors here.
