Setting up any UNIX like system comes down to a single startup file. There could be many, if one wants to, the freedom is always there. But generally it starts at a single point.

# OSX / MacOS

In this land the file is `.bash_profile`. Almost all the things can be configured here.

# UBUNTU / Linux

Here the file is `.bashrc`. All the `PATH` and systemwide settings reside here.

> Both of these files stay in the `root` of the `user` home folder in both `MacOS` and `UBUNTU`. This folder is referred as `~/` in both the Operating Systems.

On UBUNTU, one can put the configuration in `.bash_profile`, but then to see the effect, the requirement is to logout of the system and login again.
