For a casual use, `Snaps` seem good. Once it gets regular updates, it becomes obvious that it needs maintenance too.

> Unlike the `.deb` packages, these things keep on installing all the dependent packages along with the update.

The main reason I dig into this is for slowness I found while using `Snap` for all the things. Sublime, VS Code and Chromium, VLC etc; all these I was running at the same time.

Now all my apps are either `.deb` or `.AppImage` and this seems working fine till now. If there is an official package available, I use it from `apt` or else `.deb` and `.AppImage`. Got these `Snap` apps out.

Not very sure why Ubuntu is insisting on `Snap` apps!
