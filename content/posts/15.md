Installing a `VIM` plugin in Ubuntu is not that complicated as it used to be. All one has to do is put the plugin in a proper folder. However, do not confuse yourself `VIM` with `VI`. By default Ubuntu comes installed with `VI` and not `VIM`. Even if you put the `VIM` plugin in the proper place, it will not reflect in this editor.

> First install [VIM][1].

For Ubuntu it is just `sudo apt install vim`. This is the critical step. Next is `NERDTree` a popular plugin and a must have for any `VIM` user. The path to put a plugin for NERDTree is similar as     

> ~/.vim/pack/vendor/start/nerdtree


So any plugin will live inside `~/.vim` folder. There might be a chance this folder does not exists!

> Create ~/.vim folder     

Inside that create `pack/vendor/start` folder. Then create a folder with the name of the plugin. If the plugin is available in GitHub, clone the repository in this folder. That is all to it.

Here is the [link to NERDTree][2]

Configuring [VIM][1] further can be started with `.vimrc` file present at `~/`. There might be a chance, this file does not exists! Start by creating a file at `~/` with name `.vimrc`.

Here is [my list of useful comands][3] for VIM.

Happy Coding.
