Updating a state in [React][1] looks something like below.

```
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	setCount(5)
```

Here the new value of the `count` is provided to `setCount`. That updates the `state` of `count` to its new value.

This is the most used form of the `state` update.

However, there is another form of this functionality. This looks like below.

```
	setState( previousState=>{
		// Do Something with Previous Data
		// And return the newly created Data
		return( newState )
		} )
```

So the code `setCount(5)` will become like below.

```
	setCount( previousCount => { return(5) } )
```

This is a most useful utility once you fall into a place where you need it.

Happy Coding.
