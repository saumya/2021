        ReactNative. Developing on Windows
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      I always knew this from my experience that, Windows, the OS is broken in a lot of ways for development. However, once I shifted out of it never thought about it. In a recent turn of events, I am back in a Windows Machine for ReactNative development. And the old ghosts are back alive! Tried a lot of things, but the old trick did the job for me.
In my project, I was constantly getting this error while building for Android.

        Zig
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      For sometime now, I was searching for an alternative for Go. While the language itself is nice and I am productive with it, there are reasons to look elsewhere.
 Now stared with Zig.
 While working with Go, I thought there could not be simpler thing than this. Installation is smooth, works on every platform and fast. Infact this blog runs on Hugo, which runs on Go. But lately there are data mining and other corporate politics is happening in that space.

      This is addition to the last two posts regarding Yarn.
 Setting different Yarn versions in Ubuntu / Linux Working with YARN  Now after working with it for more than 2 years, it feels that Yarn 1 is more useful. Though, technically Yarn 2 has all the best intentions and implementations, there are situations where Yarn 1 just works.
How to remove Yarn 2 completely from Ubuntu I am using NVM for managing different NodeJS versions.

        Ubuntu 23.04 fixed with an update
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      In my last post I talked about the problem with Ubuntu 23.04.
While my laptop was workable but not optimal. I could not controll the brightness of the screen. I was hoping Ubuntu will fix this with an update. And that is what has happened.
sudo apt updatesudo apt upgradeThose two are not new to any Ubuntu user. But with these two, Ubuntu got the fix for the brightness control problem.
