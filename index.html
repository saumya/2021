        Alpine JS
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      In the noisy space of Javascript and Javascript Frameworks, this one is nice and quiet. The simplicity of this framework dragged me into it. This happens to me for a new framework which does the thing and keeps it simple. Same thing happened to me when React came in. Appart from its corporate backing, it did work for a couple of years. As usual slowly complexity built arround it. I am afraid Alpine might go that route.

        Copying folder with Python
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Python is powerful like anyother programming language. However the simplicity of it makes it more beautiful.
I was trying to automate some of my tasks and this needed copying of a folder with all its files and folders and files inside those folders to a new location. With Python it just took some lines and the task is done!
 import shutil
shutil.copytree(source_folder, destination_folder, dirs_exist_ok = True)
 The shutil is a utility to deal with file operations.

        Setting different Yarn versions in Ubuntu / Linux
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      This should be a one liner as per the Yarn Docs.
It doesnot work always like that.
The problem This happens if you have installed the latest version of Yarn. Then and only then one can change Yarn versions. After installing the latest version of Yarn, we can use the old version by setting Yarn to older version.
 yarn set version classic
 The classic version is 1.x version.

        Reviving my MacBookPro
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      The thing is, Apple does not care about anything else but money.
 Apple products are good. They work as Apple expects them to work. People just follow along and pride themselves for having an Apple device. The products die when Apple wants them to die.  Now my device, MacBookPro which is still good in terms of Hardware, Apple software does not get updated in this. As per Apple the device needs an upgrade.

        Powerline Fish
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Powerline is a wonderful utility apart from visually pleasing shell prompts.
In the early days it was a whole lot of effort to install and apply it to Linux / Ubuntu. However the situations have changed. Now it is
sudo apt install powerline and there you have it.
Now to add this to Fish, the best way is to use Oh My Fish. Once Oh My Fish is installed, enable bobthefish theme.
