Working in [Yarn][2] was a little involved. That is [Yarn][2] version 1. One has to play around with Node and NPM to make things setup. With [Yarn][1] version 2 and above, this is mostly done by Node and a new utility called `corepack`.

Now, [Yarn][1] does not need to be installed as a global package. [Yarn][1] can be enabled for individual projects (individual folders).

> The `corepack enable` is all there is to it.

Open the command prompt and move to the folder, where `Yarn` is needed. 
Once there, either initialise an empty Yarn project. That will takecare of everything. 

If you are working with an existing project and checked out the code to a folder. Move to this folder from your command prompt. Then run the command `corepack enable`. That is all.

Now all the `yarn` commands can work from this folder. 

If the project is a `Yarn 1` project, it will work with `Yarn 1` tools and if it is a `Yarn 2` or above project, it will run with the expected [Yarn][1] tools.
