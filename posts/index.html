        Hugo &amp; Paths
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Hugo is fast and just works. However there are certain things you must take into consideration while hosting it.
Till now one thing I came across is the path for css files. Hugo provides template short codes to deal with them.
 The templating system cares for empty spaces in the template.
 You should be extra careful not to put them. For example href=&quot;{{ .Site.BaseURL }}css/2021.css&quot; and href=&quot;{{ .Site.BaseURL }} css/2021.

      A long wait is finally over.
For a long long time I was lazy and was avoiding the work. But here it is.
Moved to the Hugo Engine from Wintersmith Engine.
Never thought I will continue this way. But this is good to start over and over again. This is life if one wants to live. Re-start, Re-build, Re-structure and keep living.
The last blog is here for the new visitors here.
