      <p>For sometime now, I was searching for an alternative for <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>. While the language itself is nice and I am productive with it, there are reasons to look elsewhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now stared with <a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>While working with <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>, I thought there could not be simpler thing than this. Installation is smooth, works on every platform and fast. Infact this blog runs on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, which runs on <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>. But lately there are data mining and other corporate politics is happening in that space. After all Google!</p>
<p>I was hearing about <a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a>, but never really looked into it. This weekend finally I got into making something with it. It is not much but a commandline program to get some values and display some values. Took me just few minutes to be productive. Same feeling as in <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a> but then found the alternative.</p>
<p>Installation is just unzipping a folder and adding that to the system&rsquo;s path. And we are ready to <a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a>. It has C and C++ compiler built in, it can compile for another OS from another OS!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s <a href="https://ziglang.org">Zig</a> now.</p>
