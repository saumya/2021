    <h1>ReactNative. Developing on Windows</h1>

      <p>I always knew this from my experience that, <code>Windows, the OS is broken</code> in a lot of ways for development. However, once I shifted out of it never thought about it. In a recent turn of events, I am back in a <code>Windows Machine</code> for ReactNative development. And the old ghosts are back alive! Tried a lot of things, but the old trick did the job for me.</p>
<p>In my project, I was constantly getting this error while building for Android.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ninja: error: manifest &lsquo;build.ninja&rsquo; still dirty after 100 tries</p></blockquote>
<p>After a week of trying by myself and troubling the team, i found this to be a known problem having multiple solutions, like <a href="https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/issues/1599">this(1)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/issues/1941">this(2)</a> ! For me the solution was given by someone in the <a href="https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-vision-camera/issues/1941">option 2</a>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just a weird problem with Windows. I made it work just by moving the project folder to a shorter path.</p></blockquote>
<p>This I knew since <code>Windows 98</code> days! And this is still true in 2023! The underlaying OS is somewhere broken for development.</p>
<p>No matter how much sugar coated the system is, it is not for a serious develpment experience except <code>Windows only</code> development things.</p>
