        Removing Yarn 2.x
      </div>

    <div class="summary-description">
      This is addition to the last two posts regarding Yarn.
Setting different Yarn versions in Ubuntu / Linux Working with YARN Now after working with it for more than 2 years, it feels that Yarn 1 is more useful. Though, technically Yarn 2 has all the best intentions and implementations, there are situations where Yarn 1 just works.
How to remove Yarn 2 completely from Ubuntu I am using NVM for managing different NodeJS versions.

      I was holding myself from saying anything about it for last two and half years. The incredible journey to the release of the first product and now the second product is online to the global audience.
The team is beautiful. Fast. To the point. Remote.
It is an honor to work with the team. While serving the world and releasing updates, it never felt anyone is down. Energy is high and flowing.

        Ubuntu 23.04 fixed with an update
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      In my last post I talked about the problem with Ubuntu 23.04.
While my laptop was workable but not optimal. I could not controll the brightness of the screen. I was hoping Ubuntu will fix this with an update. And that is what has happened.
sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade Those two are not new to any Ubuntu user. But with these two, Ubuntu got the fix for the brightness control problem.

        Ubuntu 23.04, something is missing.
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      I updated my machine to Ubuntu 23.04.
There are so many things which are just smoother to work with.
The system itself, seems to be faster. I think this is because Snaps just start instantly! I did not believe this for the fist time! This one is the best thing to happen in my opinion. I have tried opening everything that should take sometime to open, but no the just open instantly.

      This is about implementing an idea and seeing it in the market.
Jump into it. Give it all that you have and see.
There is a huge difference between just sitting in the side and validating something or putting the effort to actully make it. As I see it, failed in terms of market and money is fine. But that gives immense idea about the reality of the world. If you know to code, making a software product is easy.
