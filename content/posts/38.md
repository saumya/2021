The latest LTS release of Ubuntu, 24.04 is having a very unstable installer.

> I could install it from the installer in some machines without any problem.

However, the installer simply is a UI only update. On the UX side it fails completely. Seems there is no error handling done. On simplest of things, the installer just shuts down.

On one of my laptops, I find it is very difficult to go forword with installation. Made an attempt to install the previous version of Ubuntu, which is 22.04 and it went smooth.

I hope the new installer has a lot to be fixed, behind the nice UI. In that case, it will be usable else install 22.04 and then update it from inside the Operating System.
