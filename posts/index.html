        React State update
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Updating a state in React looks something like below.
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0) setCount(5) Here the new value of the count is provided to setCount. That updates the state of count to its new value.
This is the most used form of the state update.
However, there is another form of this functionality. This looks like below.
	setState( previousState=&gt;{ // Do Something with Previous Data // And return the newly created Data return( newState ) } ) So the code setCount(5) will become like below.

        React Component and props.children
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      The game of React is in its components. Almost everything here is a component. Sooner or later the need to pass properties to components will arise. This is straight forward as we know like this.
&lt;MyComp myTitle='Nice Component' /&gt; Inside component we can access this with props.myTitle.
const MyComp = (props)=&gt;{	return( &lt;div&gt; { props.myTitle } &lt;/div&gt; ) } This can also be written as below.
const MyComp = ( {myTitle} )=&gt;{	return( &lt;div&gt; { myTitle } &lt;/div&gt; ) }  There is a nice magic props that React has, on all the components.

        Managing Component Code in ReactJS
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      React defines and speculates about how to manage code files for components. There are so many documentation and tools available as per the best practices and perfect scenaios. However as per my experience no perfect scenario ever worked for any individual or company.
 There is difference between perfect scenario and working scenario.
 While everyone should try to stick to the best practices and perfect scenarios, it is a perpetual job.

I never felt this kind of freedom and productive before. Now I can say it is even better than MacOS in terms of developer freedom and easiness. It is better than Windows in terms of GUI applications.

        SVG on Web
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      SVG is fine jsut to know it as an image format.
However, to deal with SVG on a web application as a developer is a different thing. SVG is too generic for better or worse as Javascript. Unless you know your way through it, it might seem confusing or easy.
First is there are many ways to include SVG in web.
The basic is just the tag itself. It is a valid HTML tag.

        VIM Plugin NERDTree

    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Installing a VIM plugin in Ubuntu is not that complicated as it used to be. All one has to do is put the plugin in a proper folder. However, do not confuse yourself VIM with VI. By default Ubuntu comes installed with VI and not VIM. Even if you put the VIM plugin in the proper place, it will not reflect in this editor.
 First install VIM.
 For Ubuntu it is just sudo apt install vim.

    <div class="summary-description">
      In the noisy space of Javascript and Javascript Frameworks, this one is nice and quiet. The simplicity of this framework dragged me into it. This happens to me for a new framework which does the thing and keeps it simple. Same thing happened to me when React came in. Appart from its corporate backing, it did work for a couple of years. As usual slowly complexity built arround it. I am afraid Alpine might go that route.

      Python is powerful like anyother programming language. However the simplicity of it makes it more beautiful.
I was trying to automate some of my tasks and this needed copying of a folder with all its files and folders and files inside those folders to a new location. With Python it just took some lines and the task is done!
 import shutil
shutil.copytree(source_folder, destination_folder, dirs_exist_ok = True)
 The shutil is a utility to deal with file operations.

    <div class="summary-description">
      This should be a one liner as per the Yarn Docs.
It doesnot work always like that.
The problem This happens if you have installed the latest version of Yarn. Then and only then one can change Yarn versions. After installing the latest version of Yarn, we can use the old version by setting Yarn to older version.
 yarn set version classic
 The classic version is 1.x version.

      Powerline is a wonderful utility apart from visually pleasing shell prompts.
In the early days it was a whole lot of effort to install and apply it to Linux / Ubuntu. However the situations have changed. Now it is
sudo apt install powerline and there you have it.
Now to add this to Fish, the best way is to use Oh My Fish. Once Oh My Fish is installed, enable bobthefish theme.

UBUNTU / Linux Here the file is .bashrc. All the PATH and systemwide settings reside here.
 Both of these files stay in the root of the user home folder in both MacOS and UBUNTU.

      The natural progress of the frontend tooling. Whether you like it or not, change is here to stay. At the moment the frontend frameworks have reached a point, where we need something else to have a better Developer Experience.
 Applications were always like this and will remain like this.
 What could change is how we write these applications. Divisions have been made to separate the concerns. However in frontend, we had put very little effort in terms of development for a long long time.

 All the reusabilty and other thoughts look good in books. In reality I have hardly seen any code is re-used. This is not to diminish the reusabilty of the code.

      A must upgrade version of React is React 17. I was surprised by the things it brings to the equation.
 I was working on a project which is old. Not so old but kind of not recent also. And we just pushed our production application to live environment.
 At that point I have some time to update the project. So I did. The first upgrade I thought should be the React library itself.

        Hugo &amp; Paths

    <div class="summary-description">
      Hugo is fast and just works. However there are certain things you must take into consideration while hosting it.
Till now one thing I came across is the path for css files. Hugo provides template short codes to deal with them.
 The templating system cares for empty spaces in the template.
 You should be extra careful not to put them. For example href=&quot;{{ .Site.BaseURL }}css/2021.css&quot; and href=&quot;{{ .Site.BaseURL }} css/2021.
