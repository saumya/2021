      <p>I updated my machine to Ubuntu 23.04.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are so many things which are just smoother to work with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The system itself, seems to be faster. I think this is because Snaps just start instantly! I did not believe this for the fist time! This one is the best thing to happen in my opinion. I have tried opening everything that should take sometime to open, but no the just open instantly.</p>
<p>I am a Snap user and this update fixed that one thing which was bad UX for Snaps, opening the application instantly.</p>
<p>While everything seemed to be nice, I found the <code>Brightness Control</code> is missing! First I thought it might be hidden somewhere in the settings UI. Went on a search for it, but no.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the only problem of this update.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hopefully this gets fixed in the next update.</p>
