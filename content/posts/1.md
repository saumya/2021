A long wait is finally over.

For a long long time I was lazy and was avoiding the work. But here it is.

Moved to the [Hugo Engine][1] from [Wintersmith Engine][2].

Never thought I will continue this way. But this is good to start over and over again. This is life if one wants to live. Re-start, Re-build, Re-structure and keep living.

The [last blog is here][3] for the new visitors here.

For last some years my frequency of blogging was slower than usual. That was another reason, why I was not putting effort on upgrading to new engine. Somehow things are moving in a different direction. That made me think, if I am going to do it anyway, why not now. So the upgrade. And with this, I have released the [theme(GoWalk) of this site as opensource][4]. It is simple and open, customise it and use it, if you want.

Have a happy life.
