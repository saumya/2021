      I was holding myself from saying anything about it for last two and half years. The incredible journey to the release of the first product and now the second product is online to the global audience.
The team is beautiful. Fast. To the point. Remote.
It is an honor to work with the team. While serving the world and releasing updates, it never felt anyone is down. Energy is high and flowing.

        Ubuntu 23.04 fixed with an update
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      In my last post I talked about the problem with Ubuntu 23.04.
While my laptop was workable but not optimal. I could not controll the brightness of the screen. I was hoping Ubuntu will fix this with an update. And that is what has happened.
sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade Those two are not new to any Ubuntu user. But with these two, Ubuntu got the fix for the brightness control problem.

        Ubuntu 23.04, something is missing.

    <div class="summary-description">
      I updated my machine to Ubuntu 23.04.
There are so many things which are just smoother to work with.
The system itself, seems to be faster. I think this is because Snaps just start instantly! I did not believe this for the fist time! This one is the best thing to happen in my opinion. I have tried opening everything that should take sometime to open, but no the just open instantly.

    <div class="summary-description">
      This is about implementing an idea and seeing it in the market.
Jump into it. Give it all that you have and see.
There is a huge difference between just sitting in the side and validating something or putting the effort to actully make it. As I see it, failed in terms of market and money is fine. But that gives immense idea about the reality of the world. If you know to code, making a software product is easy.

It happened last week, Inner Engineering Completion in person program, near me. Personally, it was a long wait to be a part of this event in person. Never thought, it would be such a surprise to me! Overall it was as usual, pleasant and smooth with high energy flowing all-around. I bow down to all the volunteers, who brought it here.
Being a Volunteer in the event has a different meaning altogether.
