My working machine is a `Linux` machine for some years now.

I never felt this kind of freedom and productive before. Now I can say it is even better than `MacOS` in terms of developer freedom and easiness. It is better than `Windows` in terms of GUI applications. The time has gone when `Linux` used to be command only. Today the GUI applications are much better in Linux than Windows.

Some days back, I have updated my `Ubuntu` to recent LTS version, 22.04. This is my experience of the first somedays use of it.

This is the best update of `Ubuntu` till date. The process is similar to usual Linux updates. From commandline. Just connect to the internet and update the Operating System. Once done, restart the machine and ready for the surprise. The whole UI is updated, it is subtle but elegant. It runs well in low end machine. The applications take sometime to start, this is the only downside of this update. However, once it is started, all is good.
