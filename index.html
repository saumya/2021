        Ubuntu and Snaps

    <div class="summary-description">
      <p>For a casual use, <code>Snaps</code> seem good. Once it gets regular updates, it becomes obvious that it needs maintenance too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the <code>.deb</code> packages, these things keep on installing all the dependent packages along with the update.</p></blockquote>
<p>The main reason I dig into this is for slowness I found while using <code>Snap</code> for all the things. Sublime, VS Code and Chromium, VLC etc; all these I was running at the same time.</p>

    <div class="summary-description">
      <p>I generally prefer to stay on the stable versions of Linux and keep on doing the work on the same system. Tried <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and got used to it. Never bothered to install a second distro for work. The configurations to <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> also as per my work requirements. This whole disro-hop thing is never my thing. Though on side, I use to see what is happening in that space. Configuring or ricing as it is said now, is also seems too much for me.</p>

      <p>Seems like a known bug.</p>

<p>Upgrade from 22.04 LTS to 24.04 LTS and the connection to internet is broken</p></blockquote>
<p>In my case, I upgraded to 24.04.1. The bug still is there. The fix I do is from <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1530964">this place</a>. I have to do it almost every time I open the OS.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo dhcpcd
</code></pre><p>Now as <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1530964">mentioned in the post</a> internet is back but the icon on the taskbar is still broken. To fix this UI, this is the command.</p>

        Ubuntu 24.04 is with an unstable installer
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      <p>The latest LTS release of Ubuntu, 24.04 is having a very unstable installer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could install it from the installer in some machines without any problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the installer simply is a UI only update. On the UX side it fails completely. Seems there is no error handling done. On simplest of things, the installer just shuts down.</p>
<p>On one of my laptops, I find it is very difficult to go forword with installation. Made an attempt to install the previous version of Ubuntu, which is 22.04 and it went smooth.</p>
