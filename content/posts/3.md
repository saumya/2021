For last 5 months, I was working on a new project. Finally it went live last week. 

> It is such an experience to be involved in this kind of projects.

In terms of frontend technology it is [React][react] through and through. It was a re-write of the old project. The project has a global reach and directly affects people. Whatever we are doing has a direct effect on the general people. So the feedback loop is very small. We have to be on the edge all the time. Any small UX change has an immediate reaction from the user and reaching us within minutes. It is exciting and lot involved.

The typical corporate or in that matter start-up (which behaves like corporates only, now a days) is far less interesting. Where people portray their involvement and management thinks it is good that way. 

> This project team is completely remote. 

The team is welcoming and information just flows. Unlike corporates which thrive on information hiding and politics culture. People are ready to learn and provide feedback instantaneously without sugar coating. This makes the project move faster and transparently forward. The age group and gender does not define the capability or performance or scope of work.

Over all it was such a nice and exciting experience.

Happy coding.
