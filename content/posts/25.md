I updated my machine to Ubuntu 23.04.

> There are so many things which are just smoother to work with.

The system itself, seems to be faster. I think this is because Snaps just start instantly! I did not believe this for the fist time! This one is the best thing to happen in my opinion. I have tried opening everything that should take sometime to open, but no the just open instantly.

I am a Snap user and this update fixed that one thing which was bad UX for Snaps, opening the application instantly.

While everything seemed to be nice, I found the `Brightness Control` is missing! First I thought it might be hidden somewhere in the settings UI. Went on a search for it, but no.

> This is the only problem of this update.

Hopefully this gets fixed in the next update.
