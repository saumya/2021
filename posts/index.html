      <p>Seems like a known bug.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upgrade from 22.04 LTS to 24.04 LTS and the connection to internet is broken</p></blockquote>
<p>In my case, I upgraded to 24.04.1. The bug still is there. The fix I do is from <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1530964">this place</a>. I have to do it almost every time I open the OS.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo dhcpcd
</code></pre><p>Now as <a href="https://askubuntu.com/a/1530964">mentioned in the post</a> internet is back but the icon on the taskbar is still broken. To fix this UI, this is the command.</p>

        Ubuntu 24.04 is with an unstable installer
      </div>

    <div class="summary-description">
      <p>The latest LTS release of Ubuntu, 24.04 is having a very unstable installer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I could install it from the installer in some machines without any problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the installer simply is a UI only update. On the UX side it fails completely. Seems there is no error handling done. On simplest of things, the installer just shuts down.</p>
<p>On one of my laptops, I find it is very difficult to go forword with installation. Made an attempt to install the previous version of Ubuntu, which is 22.04 and it went smooth.</p>

        NPM script basics
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      <p>In <code>package.json</code> there is a <code>script</code> section. From here one can run NPM Scripts.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;scripts&#34;: {
	&#34;one&#34;: &#34;scriptOne.js&#34;,
	&#34;two&#34;: &#34;scriptTwo.js&#34;
}
</code></pre><p>These can be run like this.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>npm run one
</code></pre><p>This particular line will run <code>scriptOne.js</code>. This is powerful as we could take Node&rsquo;s power and run any automated task for ourselves.</p>
<p>At first this seemed simple to me. Soon I came across cross-platform bugs. Since we are writing this in <code>JS</code>, it could be run anywhere <code>Node</code> is available. Now that could be a tricky thing. Some environments deal with certain things in a certain way. This is not a big thing if the script is written to handle those situations. Another thing is <code>Node</code> versions. If the script is written using certain API of a particular <code>Node</code> version, it is better to keep an eye on new releases of Node and update the script if there are breaking changes.</p>

        NeoVIM on Windows

    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      <p>We will be talking about Windows 11 and NeoVIM. It can be seen as general Windows not specific to Windows 11, since I have done it in Windows 11, thought would mention it here in order to avoid the confusion.</p>
<p>On Windows machines I avoided configuring or even using NeoVIM. Thought it would be much more painful here as compared to Linux. So started using NeoVIM on WSL. Configured and ready within a couple of minutes as that is basically all Linux. Then I thought, let me try on Windows once and that would be final. If it runs fine if not better. It seemed the people at NeoVIM has made it clear that this thing is for everyone, including Windows people.</p>

      <p>Configuring NeoVIM is straight forward. All one need to know is, where to put what.</p>
<p>Here is a <a href="#reference-readings">list of references</a> to get started with it.</p>
<p>For me, it was not difficult as I just needed a decent text editor with a file tree. All I did is pull the respective github repos into the folder and call them from <code>init,lua</code>. This is nice and fine but since the configuration is too easy and <code>Lua</code> just feels good to play with, thinking of confuguring it further and play with plugin managers.</p>

<p>The problem is never the tool itself. How it is been used, the implementation details. That is the place, where it matters.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the last days of FlashPlayer, the company and the community both jumped into Flex, the framework and the tool-chain to say, <code>everything can be fixed with it</code>! Any and all problems seemed just not enough for Flex. It can do this, it can do that and the story went on. This is what happens when <code>you try to please the corporates</code>. FlashPlayer and Flash IDE are still the best ones out there for a creative and interactive experience. This can not be said for Flex, which is a corporate pleasing Framework / tool chain on top of FlashPlayer. Un/Fortunately the whole Flex thing went down and took Flash with it.</p>

<p>However, now a days there is one more / extra step before installing Linux(specifically Ubuntu) on a Windows machine.

      <p>Updating a state in <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> looks something like below.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

<p>This is the most used form of the <code>state</code> update.</p>
<p>However, there is another form of this functionality. This looks like below.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>	setState( previousState=&gt;{

		// And return the newly created Data
		return( newState )

<p>You should be extra careful not to put them.
For example <code>href=&quot;{{ .Site.BaseURL }}css/2021.css&quot;</code> and <code>href=&quot;{{ .Site.BaseURL }} css/2021.css&quot;</code> are different. Can you see there is a space between <code>}}</code> and <code>css/2021.css</code> in the second example. These kind of things will break the site or theme or both.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://saumya.github.io/ray/">last blog is here</a> for the new visitors here.</p>
<p>For last some years my frequency of blogging was slower than usual. That was another reason, why I was not putting effort on upgrading to new engine. Somehow things are moving in a different direction. That made me think, if I am going to do it anyway, why not now. So the upgrade. And with this, I have released the <a href="https://github.com/saumya/saumya_go_walk">theme(GoWalk) of this site as opensource</a>. It is simple and open, customise it and use it, if you want.</p>
