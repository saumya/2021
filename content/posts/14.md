In the noisy space of Javascript and Javascript Frameworks, this one is nice and quiet. The simplicity of this framework dragged me into it. This happens to me for a new framework which does the thing and keeps it simple. Same thing happened to me when [React][3] came in. Appart from its corporate backing, it did work for a couple of years. As usual slowly complexity built arround it. I am afraid [Alpine][1] might go that route. But till then let's enjoy it.

> There is no toolchain.

Biggest problem in today's javascript frameworks is the `toolchain` arround it. [Alpine][1] just do not have it. Well one can use `npm` to install it, if the need be. But just include the `script` tag and we are ready with it.

> Plain old fun days of Javascript.

At the same time, it brings all the reactivity of [ReactJS][3] and similar frameworks.

One can start coding in the same HTML page and use `script` tags to add Javascript into it. Then ship it like that.

The simplicity of Web and with today's reactivity, all served. At first I ignored it for sometime. When I really found sometime to go a little deep and saw the things it is doing, I am impressed.

To build it from [Github][2] is also as simple as `npm build` and then serve it from your server.

Happy Coding.
