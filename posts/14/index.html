      <p>In the noisy space of Javascript and Javascript Frameworks, this one is nice and quiet. The simplicity of this framework dragged me into it. This happens to me for a new framework which does the thing and keeps it simple. Same thing happened to me when <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> came in. Appart from its corporate backing, it did work for a couple of years. As usual slowly complexity built arround it. I am afraid <a href="https://alpinejs.dev/">Alpine</a> might go that route. But till then let&rsquo;s enjoy it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no toolchain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Biggest problem in today&rsquo;s javascript frameworks is the <code>toolchain</code> arround it. <a href="https://alpinejs.dev/">Alpine</a> just do not have it. Well one can use <code>npm</code> to install it, if the need be. But just include the <code>script</code> tag and we are ready with it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plain old fun days of Javascript.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the same time, it brings all the reactivity of <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a> and similar frameworks.</p>
<p>One can start coding in the same HTML page and use <code>script</code> tags to add Javascript into it. Then ship it like that.</p>
<p>The simplicity of Web and with today&rsquo;s reactivity, all served. At first I ignored it for sometime. When I really found sometime to go a little deep and saw the things it is doing, I am impressed.</p>
<p>To build it from <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine">Github</a> is also as simple as <code>npm build</code> and then serve it from your server.</p>
<p>Happy Coding.</p>
