      Setting up any UNIX like system comes down to a single startup file. There could be many, if one wants to, the freedom is always there. But generally it starts at a single point.
OSX / MacOS In this land the file is .bash_profile. Almost all the things can be configured here.
UBUNTU / Linux Here the file is .bashrc. All the PATH and systemwide settings reside here.
 Both of these files stay in the root of the user home folder in both MacOS and UBUNTU.

      The year started slow but kept up the steadiness. There were a lot of endings and new beginnings. As always if it flows, it is life.
Tech and work  A new project started.
 For a long long time I was in a stealth mode. Bootstrapping and failing, then start over again and fail. The cycle finally ended. There are huge experience gain in terms of building a product and selling it.

      The natural progress of the frontend tooling. Whether you like it or not, change is here to stay. At the moment the frontend frameworks have reached a point, where we need something else to have a better Developer Experience.
 Applications were always like this and will remain like this.
 What could change is how we write these applications. Divisions have been made to separate the concerns. However in frontend, we had put very little effort in terms of development for a long long time.

      The thing that is fixed in code is the change. While lot of books and philosophy is done towards how to reuse the code, very little is focused towards the change!
 The reality of the life of the code is very different from the literature around it.
 All the reusabilty and other thoughts look good in books. In reality I have hardly seen any code is re-used. This is not to diminish the reusabilty of the code.

      The age old problem which repeats itself is, how to make a single code base for a project which is delivered to multiple platforms?!
 Many tachnologies has come and promised the same thing. The end result is to enter the corporate space. Why!? Money.
 This is the true story of all the technology stacks which promise to have a single codebase. Some really nice technologies has come and stayed for good, some vanished without leaving a trace.
