This is addition to the last two posts regarding [Yarn][yarn].

 - [Setting different Yarn versions in Ubuntu / Linux][y1-relative]
 - [Working with YARN][y2-relative]

Now after working with it for more than 2 years, it feels that [Yarn 1][yarn-1] is more useful. Though, technically [Yarn 2][yarn] has all the best intentions and implementations, there are situations where [Yarn 1][yarn-1] just works.

### How to remove [Yarn 2][yarn] completely from Ubuntu

I am using [NVM][nvm] for managing different [NodeJS][nodejs] versions. So the removing of some files and folders may be different in terms of their `path`. However overall it will be the same process if one has installed [Yarn][yarn] on a standalone [NodeJS][nodejs] installation.

If you have gone through [this post][y1-relative], I have shown the standard removing process of [Yarn][yarn]. However this post is an addition to that, showing the extra files and folders, one might be having in the machine.


 1. Remove these files from the folder at `~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.20.1/lib/node_modules/corepack/dist/` 
  
	- yarn.js
	- yarnpkg.js

 2. Remove these files from the folder at `~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.20.1/bin/`
	
	- yarn
	- yarnpkg


In this case I am using `Node 16.20.1`, so the folder `path` has got that. Depending upon your version of NodeJS, the path will be like that.

> Just to be sure, remove any Yarn related files and folders from the working folder of your code. Which might have generated when migrating to [Yarn 2][yarn] from [Yarn 1][yarn-1].

That is all. Next is install [Yarn 1][yarn-1] with 

```
npm -g install yarn
```

Happy coding.
