        NeoVIM Configuration basics
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Configuring NeoVIM is straight forward. All one need to know is, where to put what.
Here is a list of references to get started with it.
For me, it was not difficult as I just needed a decent text editor with a file tree. All I did is pull the respective github repos into the folder and call them from init,lua. This is nice and fine but since the configuration is too easy and Lua just feels good to play with, thinking of confuguring it further and play with plugin managers.

      I never thought, the day will come! The story of VIM addiction and NeoVIM adoption.
In search of a code editor which is available everywhere, from Desktop to servers, I accidentally got used to vi some years back. I had to edit some files on the server or they call it Cloud, the only editor available there was vi. I just used it and forgot it as it was not even close to anything that modern code editors offer.

        Using a tool

      Is it a library or a framework?!
 Do not know, but everyone is using it.
 Must be good.
 Hype Driven Development.
 It should be a known story for experienced developers. For new developers it is alright to start here.
 The problem is never the tool itself. How it is been used, the implementation details. That is the place, where it matters.
 During the last days of FlashPlayer, the company and the community both jumped into Flex, the framework and the tool-chain to say, everything can be fixed with it!

        Secure boot. Installing Linux on a Windows machine.

    <div class="summary-description">
      Installing Linux side by side on a Windows machine, was and still is simple.
However, now a days there is one more / extra step before installing Linux(specifically Ubuntu) on a Windows machine. Now a days the hardware and the boot option comes with a setting called Secure Boot. This option is by default it is enabled for a new laptop running on Windows 11. This is to make the system secure at boot level and Windows 11 requires this option to be available in order to be installed on the system.

        ReactNative. Developing on Windows
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      I always knew this from my experience that, Windows, the OS is broken in a lot of ways for development. However, once I shifted out of it never thought about it. In a recent turn of events, I am back in a Windows Machine for ReactNative development. And the old ghosts are back alive! Tried a lot of things, but the old trick did the job for me.
In my project, I was constantly getting this error while building for Android.
