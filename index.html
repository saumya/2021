      This is about implementing an idea and seeing it in the market.
Jump into it. Give it all that you have and see.
There is a huge difference between just sitting in the side and validating something or putting the effort to actully make it. As I see it, failed in terms of market and money is fine. But that gives immense idea about the reality of the world. If you know to code, making a software product is easy.

      Namaskaram.
It happened last week, Inner Engineering Completion in person program, near me. Personally, it was a long wait to be a part of this event in person. Never thought, it would be such a surprise to me! Overall it was as usual, pleasant and smooth with high energy flowing all-around. I bow down to all the volunteers, who brought it here.
Being a Volunteer in the event has a different meaning altogether.

        Instructions Work
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      What is the big deal?! It should work.
Yep, it is true.
The deal is, who takes the instructions seriously.
I am talking in general here. Once you accept something as valuable, a book or a guide, then taking it as instructed makes a whole difference. Problem arises when one becomes a little casual about the instructions of value. Then it does not matter, what are you doing, there will not be desired result.

        Product or Technology

    <div class="summary-description">
      This is always the case. It is always OR never AND.
There are talks about how technology is the key to a successful product. May be it is true in the beginning, till one has to maintain it. Almost all successful products in the market are not of the latest technolgy. There are some parts of it is new technology, but majority is old, very old. The technology they use are once new, but now it is old and that is ok.

        Working with YARN
      </div>
    </a>
    <div class="summary-description">
      Working in Yarn was a little involved. That is Yarn version 1. One has to play around with Node and NPM to make things setup. With Yarn version 2 and above, this is mostly done by Node and a new utility called corepack.
Now, Yarn does not need to be installed as a global package. Yarn can be enabled for individual projects (individual folders).
The corepack enable is all there is to it.
